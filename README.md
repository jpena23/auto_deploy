# auto_deploy

This script will automate the deployment of a Yelp Pizza App sample along with any required dependencies, if not already installed.

Environment: Linux OS - CentOS/RedHat (I used this script on CentOS 6.4 in particular)

**Instructions**
Download the "deploy.sh" script into a directory of your choice. <br />
Navigate to this directory "cd /path/to/your/directory". <br />
Run "bash deploy.sh" from the command line. <br />
The script may prompt you to enter your sudo credentials if not ran as a priveledged user. <br />
The script may prompt you to enter in your MySQL credentials if you have already have it installed. <br />

**Note**
The default password for the MySQL root password is empty. <br />
