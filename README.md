# auto_deploy

this script will automate the deployment of a Yelp Pizza App sample along with any required dependencies, if not already installed.

Environment: Linux OS - CentOS/RedHat (I used this script on CentOS 6.4 in particular)

Instructions:

download the "deploy.sh" script into a directory of your choice.
navigate to this directory "cd /path/to/your/directory".
run "bash deploy.sh" from the command line. 
the script may prompt you to enter your sudo credentials if not ran as a priveledged user.
the script may prompt you to enter in your MySQL credentials if you have already have it installed.
NOTE: the default password for the MySQL root password is empty.
